# TSWD_Project
Coral reefs and how they have degraded over the years -  A Tableau Visualization <br>

The main objective of the current visualisation project is to get an idea of how various environmental factors play a role in the bleaching of the coral reefs around various parts of the world. <br>

The dataset spans over two decades from 1998-2017. The source is the website of BCO-DMO(Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office). The data is collected by a mixture of professional scientists (56%) and trained and certified citizen-scientists (44%). The authors of the dataset have used the global Coral Reef Temperature Anomaly Database (CoRTAD Version 6) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to predict coral bleaching prevalence and intensity across reefs worldwide. The variables were collected on a weekly basis.
The current version of the dataset is downloaded from the Woods Hole Open Access Server.
